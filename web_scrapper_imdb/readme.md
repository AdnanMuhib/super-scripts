## A simple web-scrapping implementation in Python on IMDB website

Here, I have used `requests` and the `BeautifulSoup` moudule to make it happen.


It gathers the data on top 250 imdb movies and stroes them in a excel file.


Make sure the web-page which you scrape allows you to do it. And its a public web-page.


#### Happy coding!
